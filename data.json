I found this project through Craigslist while I was looking for pieces to build my demo reel during my last year at Ex'pression College for Digital Arts. This film was also a school-associated project for Mr. Scott as he was directing it while attending the Academy of Art in San Francisco. I acted as the re-recording mixer, sound designer, and I recorded the \"warning\"; voice over as well. I had a lot of fun creating sounds for the \"monster\" and I'm very pleased with how the whole piece came together.",

I would like to give thanks to all of the UC Berkeley med students that volunteer at these clinics, they are all amazing people!",
