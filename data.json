This public service announcement was created by my friend, motion graphics designer Gabe Schwartz (<a href='http://www.gabeschwartz.com/'>http://www.gabeschwartz.com/</a>). It was a volunteer piece &quot;contracted out&quot; to motion graphics students at Ex'pression College for Digital Arts by the TakePride.org campaign. I recorded the voice over performed by Lia Rubinoff and mixed it with the stock music provided to me. I was happy to be a part of this feel-good project.",

With a recent loss of city funding, this video premiered at a fundraiser for shelters to encourage donations. I contributed by providing some production sound on location, as well as helping out on the post side with some noise reduction and mixing. I would like to give thanks to all of the UC Berkeley med students that volunteer at these clinics, they are all amazing people!",

The event was a one-day film-fest; group members chosen at random and scripts written on the spot. We were given a little under a month for post production. I acted as boom operator and sound mixer during production as well as sound designer and re-recording mixer during post. For such a short project, this came out incredible!",
